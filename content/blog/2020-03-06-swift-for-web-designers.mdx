My entire life as a designer thus far has been spent working in one medium. I'm very excited to make this a false statement. SwiftUI seems like as good a challenge as any to get into designing and building native apps.

## Tooling

Let me start out by saying that XCode is an [IDE (integrated development environment)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) and most modern web development tools are not. VSCode comes close-er but it's really not the same thing. It has a editor, documentation, compiler, virtualization and a rendering engine all-in-one -- with the settings for each. It feels big in every concievable way to someone who isn't used to working in this world. In this new version of XCode (version 11.3.1), they've added another component called _Canvas_ that works exlusively with SwiftUI. Canvas is the real-time preview (+ inspector) piece that makes writing SwiftUI so compelling. With Swift (classic) and ObjectiveC apps, every time code was updated, you were required to manually build and preview the app in a seperate process. With SwiftUI, it updates as-you-type(ish) which will be familiar to folks used to live-reload in their web browsers.

The Apple team has done a decent-enough job _not_ making this version of XCode feel overly complex, but coming from the light-weight world of Vim, VSCode, Atom, and Sublime Text, I do feel like I'm driving a tank. Let's be honest though, this is a tool for making applications, not webpages and it can only be so simple. Performance-wise, it feels sluggish; syntax highlighting flickers on and off as I type, auto-indentation jumps around, the thing feels delicate and sometimes doing the same action / input will yield different results. SwiftUI _is_ in beta so I'm not expecting everything to be fully production-ready.

## Writing Swift/SwiftUI

I took an ObjectiveC class about five years ago and I don't remember it being close to this easy to pick-up and just make stuff. In fact, I think it was only on day two of that four day class that I actually had anything _real_. This is where being a web developer is awesome and why I've stayed away from learning native app development until now. I credit two things for this shift. First, diving into React and component-based web apps have trained my mind to expect more complexity these days. Second, Apple has done a great job of abstracting the things that will give you the momentum to _keep going_ and make them seem simple. "Hello world" is a thing of the past, now it's more like "hello beautiful UI complete with animations and dark-mode built-in".
