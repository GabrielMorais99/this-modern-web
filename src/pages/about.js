                My earliest post here was in 2012, so I guess you could say that
                is when I established this thing. Back then though, it was under
                my own namesake over at <em>patrickmarsceill.com</em> (which now
                redirects over here). I recently{" "}
                <Link to="/2020/02/17/new-site-who-dis/">wrote a post</Link>{" "}
                with some context as to the name change and a bit about what I'm
                trying to do here. I never really kept up a regular writing
                schedule, but these days I try to get something new up at least
                twice a week.

                I tend to write about design + tech, my own life, and
                occasionally music and film. If you're curious about what I'm

                I've loved the internet since I first logged on as a pre-teen in
                the early 90's. Since the beginning I've been fascinated with
                the ability to create for this medium. Over the years, I have
                designed + built many personal side projects, some have stood
                the test of time and others have been abandoned for more
                insteresting persuits. Here's a select few that I'm most proud
                of:

                I manage the <em>Code to Cloud</em> Product Design team at
                GitHub. We're responsible for making tools that allow developers
                to build, test, run, publish, deploy, and scale their projects.
                If you're a GitHub user, you may have seen our work in{" "}
                <em>GitHub Actions</em>, <em>GitHub Packages</em>, and{" "}

              </p>
              <p>
                In my time at GitHub, I have worked on almost every part of the
                product. I've managed teams or led design efforts on many core
                features like <em>pull requests</em>, <em>code review</em>,{" "}
                <em>security</em>, <em>ecosystem / api</em>,{" "}

              </p>
              <p>
                Before joining GitHub in 2015, I led design teams at{" "}
                <a href="https://www.happycog.com">Happy Cog</a> and Empathy Lab
                working with Fortune 500 industry leaders, scrappy start-ups,

                screens of all sizes.
